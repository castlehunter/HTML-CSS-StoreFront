                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive Design is a kind of layout style of the web page, with responsive design, the web page layout can be changed based on user behavior and the change of device screen size, that is, the web pages should be able
                    to automatically respond to the user's device environment. With the technology development, more and more devices with different screen sizes are on the market, thus, the websites that were designed only for desktop screens can no
                    longer meet people's needs, because these kinds of websites perform poorly in terms of display and response speed. The responsive design solves the problem.
                </p>
                <p class="reflect">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of responsive web design, the web technologies progress from time to time. For example, one of the main goals of responsive design is that the web pages should be loaded as quickly as possible.
                    HTML5 removed redundant tag elements and added semantic tag elements. For example, HTML5 provides semantic navigation tag &lt;nav&gt;, which makes search engines understand the web pages better than it used to. The responsive design
                    is related to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. According to the article that Ethan Marcotteto posted in 2010, “Fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries are the three technical ingredients for responsive web design”(Marcotteto, 2010).
                    In terms of fluid grids, we should set the container widths as a percentage of their parent containers, so that their width can be adjusted when the size of the parent container changes. For example, when setting the max-width property
                    to 80%, the width of the child container will be 80% of its parent container, so when the parent container scales down, the child container scales down too. This can be achieved by setting the width property to a percentage value in
                    CSS. The same technique applies to the images as well. The media query is another important component, according to Mozilla MDN Web Docs, “Media Queries enable the type of layout switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored using
                    JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.” (MDN Web Docs, n.d.).

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the research, I learned a good web app should be reader-friendly for all viewers with different devices. When building a web app, I should consider the following aspects: First, the layout and content should
                    be fluid to fit any screen size. Second, the web app should not be limited to any particular operating system. Third, we should consider the load speed of the web app on different devices. The images and videos usually consume more
                    bandwidth, so we need to optimize the web app to obtain better performance.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this course, I learned fundamental concepts and basic skills in developing web pages. Among the topics I learned, I felt that JavaScript is the most difficult part for me. Although the syntax of Javascript is similar
                    to the C language which I have already learned, it contains many new concepts that are hard to understand such as closure. The other difficult part is the CSS, this is because there are many CSS properties that need to be memorized.
                    Also, I feel like I need to practice a lot to figure out the combination of CSS properties as when properties interact, sometimes the result is unexpected.
